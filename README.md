# Input Formatting Guide

  1. Please provide your input in the following format.
  2. All values provided in a single line must be separated by a single space.
  3. First line should contain the number of cities (n), the number of connected roads (any one direction) and the number of electric vehicles (k).
  4. Second line should contain the time period used to discretize time. 1s is a good place to start. Lesser values yield more accurate results, but tend to be more prone to     errors.
  5. Follow this with n lines describing the roads, each containing the source, the destination, and the distance between, in order.
  6. Lastly, enter k pairs of lines describing the vehicles, the first line of each containing the source and destination, in order, and the second, the initial battery charge, the charging rate, the discharging rate, the maximum battery capacity, and the average speed of the vehicle, in order.
